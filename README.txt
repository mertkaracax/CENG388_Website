The main purpose of the site I have programmed is for students to present their problems about school on a single platform.
In this way, students will be organized and informed about the problems at school much faster.
In addition, students constantly choose to announce their problems about the school on the "iyte confession" page on Instagram,
but teachers or other higher authorities cannot be aware of them because they do not follow this page.
As a result, these problems generally do not go beyond being a topic of conversation among students.
As can be understood, this program aims to serve as a bridge between students and school management.

Features of the website:
-Sign In, Sign Up.
-Posting a message that everyone can see.
-Ability to update profile photo, username and phone number.
-To be able to see all posts on the home page.
-Sharing photos.

Usage:
For now, everyone has the right to enter the program by registering.
Only one user type is specified.
To register, phone number, user name and password must be entered.
The Home tab is similar to a forum home page. Every user can see the posts here. 
If you upload an image from the "Upload Image" tab, it will be displayed where you can log in with the "My Images" button.
